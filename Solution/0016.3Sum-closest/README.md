# 0016. 3Sum Closest
Given an array `nums` of n integers and an integer `target`, find three integers in `nums` such that the sum is closest to `target`. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
