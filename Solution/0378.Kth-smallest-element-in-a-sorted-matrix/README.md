# 0378. Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix
Given an `n x n` `matrix` where each of the rows and columns are sorted in ascending order, return *the `kth` smallest element in the matrix9.

Note that it is the `kth` smallest element **in the sorted order**, not the `kth` **distinct** element.

### Example 1:
```
Input: matrix = [[1,5,9],[10,11,13],[12,13,15]], k = 8
Output: 13
Explanation: The elements in the matrix are [1,5,9,10,11,12,13,13,15], and the 8th smallest number is 13
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: matrix = [[-5]], k = 1
Output: -5
```
